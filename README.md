# IRIE_termproject1_record
This is my school project which was submitted in 106-1, this is set based model for IR.

Because my code is annotated by chinese, so I'm sorry for foreign people who never learned chinese.
Maybe in future day I will translate all annotaion into english.

To use this code, first you will need data such as DBpedia-Entity v2, and put all data(e.g DBdoc.json, queries-v2.txt) with this code in same file folder.

But, I think my set based model not very good, because to do a IR task it will spent several hours to finish a job.
Perhaps is my python skill still not good enough.

But again, maybe this code will inspire someone.

follwing is the file annotation:

-set based model.py: code which implement set based model.

-result.txt: the result which this code will produce with the data list below.

-DBdoc.json: the data which I used when I was doing the project.

-qrels-v2.txt: the data which I used when I was doing the project.

-queries-v2.txt: the data which I used when I was doing the project.
